# Hello World!

## Below listed are my DS projects (sorted by latest):
###### Disclaimer: most (all actually) of the projects listed here do not have proper readmes and documentation. Effort will hopefully be taken in the future to cleanse and clearly document mentioned works.

2. ### [Depression AI | Film Fly Experience Australia Submission](https://github.com/VivekSivaramakrishnan/Depression-AI)
  - A naive attempt to build an AI that through voice input predicts the sentiment of the user.
  - The project stems from the motivation to provide mental health advice in today's time that severly lacks the required number of mental health professionals. 
  - The project has 2 classifiers:
    - Voice classiffier: Used to classify sentiment purely based on sound. The MEL's frequency sepstrum acts as the voice feature used in the prediction.
    - Text classifier: Used to classify sentiment based on words spoken. A TTS engine is used to identify words spoken, which acts as the feature to predict its respective sentiment.

3. ### Educational System | Codefest
  - A closed domain question answering chatbot was trained on a corpus of NCERT textbook material.
  - An attempt to make a google-like chatbot that helps point out references in textbooks based on questions asked was the motivation of our project. 
  - This chatbot was planned to be incorporated in a website that acts as a student forum with vibrant events and discussions - however the project died down after the Codefest got cancelled due to covid. Only the chatbot came into fruition.

4. ### [Road Fighters | Konami NES game rip off](https://github.com/VivekSivaramakrishnan/Road-Fighters)
  - This is by no means a DS project, but it's an attempt to recreate my childhood favourite NES racing game.
  - Feel free to indulge in some action yourself :)
